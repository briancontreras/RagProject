# Rag Project

Building a Rag project from scratch based off of the FreecodeCamp tutorial taught by a LangChain Engineer

[Youtube Course (Learn RAG from scratch)](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/elangosundar/awesome-README-templates)

## What is RAG?

Rag stands for: 
 - R - > Retrieval 
 - A - > Augmented
 - G - > Generation

my basic understanding is that RAG essentially combines the brain of a LLM and a set a specific data so that it can provide the best response.

## Tutorial Section

I'm converting most of the jupyter notebook files to python files just so I can start working with them in a project eventually.

To do this as I need to install a lot of packages I will use a virtual enviroment

### Create Virutal Enviroment:
This is only if you decide to make a python file, for jupyter notebooks you will not need to do anything else besides set up your .env for the api keys along with the .gitignore to not post your keys lol.
Step 1:

`python -m venv enviromentName`

Step 2: (Windows)

`myenv\Scripts\activate`

Step 2: (Mac)

`source myenv/bin/activate`

Step 3: Install pip packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

PS(If you add a package use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to auto update the requirements.txt file)

### jupyter notebook
I'm leaving person comments, to differentiate comments I made vs previous comments I used this lil sign `#B `, just for fun ig.
